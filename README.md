Objective: In this , you will scrape data from the "Buddy4Study" website, specifically focusing on scholarship information, and store the scraped data in the backend using a database of your choice, with Pinecone being the preferred option. You will then create a chatbot that can answer questions related to scholarships based on the stored data.

Tasks:

Web Scraping:

Use a web scraping tool (such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or any other preferred method) to scrape the scholarship-related information from the Buddy4Study website.
Focus on gathering data about scholarships, including details such as scholarship names, eligibility criteria, application processes, deadlines, etc.
Data Storage:

Once you have scraped the data, store it in a database of your choice, with Pinecone being the preferred storage solution. Ensure that the data is structured properly and can be easily retrieved for later use.
Store metadata for each scholarship, such as name, eligibility criteria, application instructions, and deadline.
Chatbot Creation:

Develop a chatbot that interacts with the stored scholarship data. The chatbot should be able to:
Answer questions related to specific scholarships.
Provide details about eligibility, deadlines, and other essential aspects of each scholarship.
Use the chosen database (preferably Pinecone) to retrieve and display relevant scholarship data based on user queries.
Ensure that the chatbot can understand and respond to various user queries, such as:
"What scholarships are available for students in India?"
"What is the deadline for the XYZ Scholarship?"
"Tell me about the ABC Scholarship."
Backend Setup:

Set up a backend to handle requests between the chatbot and the chosen database.
Ensure that the backend efficiently processes queries, retrieves data from the database, and returns the results to the user.
Testing and Validation:

Test the chatbot by asking a variety of scholarship-related questions and ensure the responses are accurate and relevant.
Validate that the data from Buddy4Study is being scraped correctly and stored in the database without errors.
